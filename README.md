Made this task for IEEE-CS Interviews.

It consists of 4 files, with 2 CNN models, and 1 Linear/ Logistic Regression model with file CNN1.py giving about 90.4% accuracy and CNN2 giving 91.5% accuracy.
Logistic Regression is done using saga solver for slightly higher accuracy than lbfgs, to get an accuracy of approx. 85%.

Task0.py checks and prints the data shape, displays few images with labels and verifies grayscale.

Dependencies required:

python
tensorflow
numpy
sklearn
pandas
matplotlib
